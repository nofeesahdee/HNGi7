This the beginning of the HNG internship, and all documentations will be written here.

So far in the internship, i have learnt the importance of team work and collaboration, i learnt the proper use of Git, and i was able to help others(an important aspect for me).

Knowing something isn't enough in achieving your goals, the ability to communicate your knowledge is as important as the knowledge itself and you should not be shy to hype yourself and your knowledge.

So the next task is to convert a figma design into a website, i actually had to push myself hard to do this, watched youtube videos to before starting the task. I was supposed to create a single homepage with 2 other guys, but i was not informed, so i created the whole in less than 24hours, this is huge for me. Never thought i would be able to create a single homepage within that time frame, but i did it and now i can confidently say i can transform a figma design into a website.
